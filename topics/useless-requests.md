## What is an useless request?

Your message can be considered as an "useless request" when you asked something that you shouldn't ask.

This is Dummy. He will help us to understand when we shouldn't ask for something.

Dummy joined a Discord server of a project called Cool Project. But dummy is very impatient, and quickly pinged a moderator:

He waited for hours. The moderator was active, but he never got a response.

Next day, he saw the moderator talking in the server and tried to ask again:

Unfortunately, he got timeout instead of a reply.

Dummy couldn't understand why he got timed out. Looks like he needs our help. Hey Dummy, did you check that info channel?

You didn't? Let's check together. Maybe there can be an answer to our question.

Looks like we found our answer. I assume Dummy got his lesson from this and will be more careful in the future.
