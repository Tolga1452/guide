# Duplicate Questions

## What is a duplicate question?

A question is a duplicate question when you didn't check the sources properly.

Let's say you are in a Discord server and you are asking "How can I install this?", but this question is probably already answered in a channel that named like "faq", "how-to-install", "setup". Since moderators already answered these questions as detailed as possible in specific channels, they probably won't answer your question or redirect you to the related channel.
